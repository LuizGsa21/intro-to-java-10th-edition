/**
 * (Revise Listing 21.9, CountOccurrenceOfWords.java)
 * Rewrite Listing 21.9 to display the words in ascending order
 * of occurrence counts. (Hint: Create a class named WordOccurrence
 * that implements the Comparable interface. The class contains two fields,
 * word and count. The compareTo method compares the counts. For each pair
 * in the hash set in Listing 21.9, create an instance of WordOccurrence and
 * store it in an array list. Sort the array list using the Collections.sort method.
 * What would be wrong if you stored the instances of WordOccurrence in a tree set?)
